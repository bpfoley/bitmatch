Since we bind variables, they get unused variable warnings. Because they're not
Rust's variable bindings, the variables are duplicated in the pattern guard and
the body of the arm, so using them in the pattern guard doesn't mark them as
used. Those should be marked as used in the body, and we shouldn't get any
unused variable warnings at all in the pattern guard.
